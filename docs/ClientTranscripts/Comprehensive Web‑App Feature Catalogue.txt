Comprehensive Web‑App Feature Catalogue

This document organises every identified feature of the proposed lab‑billing web application into infinitely nested categories. Each top‑level category contains sub‑categories, and within each sub‑category further nested lists describe the features. Only web‑app functions are included; business anecdotes and non‑web topics have been excluded.

User Roles & Permissions

Role Definitions

Admin (Billing Team)

Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) access across the system. Administrators can upload data, create/edit/delete invoices, manage price schedules and mapping rules, post payments, resolve disputes, add or remove clinics, and run reports.

Can configure system settings such as session timeouts, multi‑factor authentication policies, email templates and notification triggers.

Lab User (Internal)

Default access is view‑only—can see their own lab’s invoices, pricing, mapping rules and reports but cannot edit. For SaaS deployments, labs may receive admin privileges within their own isolated data “bubble.”

Cannot see data from other labs and cannot manage clinics.

Clinic User (Child Account)

Limited to their own invoices. Can view outstanding and paid invoices, pay via card/ACH, partially pay, dispute line items, and see dispute tickets. Cannot upload data or edit price schedules.

Does not see internal statuses such as Draft or Deleted. Only sees Outstanding, Paid & Partial, In Dispute, Closed.

Parent Clinic (Corporate Account)

Inherits all clinic permissions plus the ability to aggregate data and payments across its child clinics. Can make single payments that span multiple sub‑clinic invoices. Sees consolidated balances and reports.

Authentication & Session Management

OAuth Integration

Users authenticate via Microsoft (or similar) OAuth. Only authorised corporate email domains can log in.

Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enforce use of an authenticator app (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator or Duo). Text‑message or email codes are discouraged.

Session Timeout

Automatic logout after configurable inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes). Admin can adjust this duration.

Audit Logging

Every user action (viewing, editing, deleting) is logged for HIPAA compliance. Logs record the user ID, timestamp and affected data.

Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC)

System must enforce fine‑grained permissions at the module level—e.g., price‑schedule editing is restricted to admins, invoice creation restricted to admins, payment posting restricted to billing staff, dispute responses restricted to authorised billing users.

Parent clinics can access all child data; child clinics cannot view peer data or other parent’s accounts.

Invoice Management

Invoice Structure

Invoices can contain multiple patient claims. Each patient claim includes patient name, claim date, claim number and line‑item services (test code, description, price, units, etc.).

Each line item references a CPT/test code from the mapping rules and price schedule. Units reflect quantity for services like mileage.

Invoice Statuses

Draft – created but not yet final; lines can be added or removed via subsequent uploads. Not visible to clinics.

Sent – finalised; triggers email to the clinic. Cannot accept new lines; any additional lines create a new invoice.

Paid – fully paid; appears under the clinic’s “Paid & Closed” section.

Partially Paid – some but not all lines are paid; visible to clinics.

In Dispute – at least one line has been disputed; single dispute allowed per line.

Exhausted/Deleted – invoice or line is removed and no longer displayed to clinics but retained for internal record.

Invoice Editing

Admins can edit draft invoices: add new lines, modify line rates, remove line items, and save or save‑and‑resend.

Once finalised (Sent status), invoices cannot be edited except to remove lines (with greyed‑out tracking) or respond to disputes.

Clinic reassignment is discouraged because of HIPAA; instead, invoices are voided and recreated for the correct clinic.

Additional Email Recipients & Notes

Invoice editors can add or remove additional email recipients for a single invoice. This allows including secondary contacts (e.g., sales reps, office managers) when sending or resending the invoice.

Each invoice supports an internal notes area for billing‑team comments. Notes are not visible to the clinic; they capture things like “clinic has not responded,” “awaiting updated insurance,” or “call scheduled with clinic.”

A document upload field lets staff attach supporting documents (e.g., signed contracts, insurance pre‑authorisations). Uploaded documents can be labelled and kept private or shared with the clinic if flagged.

Notification Triggers & Email Templates

The system emits notifications to billing staff when key events occur: invoice sent, payment received, dispute submitted, dispute resolved, failure on email submission, etc. Notifications can appear in‑app and/or via email depending on user preferences.

Email templates are configurable for each event type. Admins can define the subject line and body with placeholders (invoice number, clinic name, amount due). All emails use a no‑reply address with a “Contact Us” link pointing to the support team.

Manual Invoice Creation

A dedicated UI form allows admins to manually create an invoice line: select clinic, input patient name, date, CPT code, units, price, and optional display note.

All fields mirror the CSV import template for consistency.

Sending & Resending Invoices

Invoices can be emailed automatically on a schedule (e.g., monthly) or manually by pressing a Send/Resend button.

Email templates (subject and body) are customisable via the settings. A no‑reply address is used, with a “contact us” link pointing to billing support.

A manual send is necessary for end‑of‑contract or “emergency” invoices; scheduling logic should not prevent manual sending.

Multiple Recipients

When sending or resending invoices, staff can add multiple recipients. The system provides a drop‑down of known contacts (e.g., clinic admin, parent account contact, sales rep) and also allows typing custom email addresses. All selected recipients receive the invoice email.

Email Submission Failure Handling

If an email bounces (invalid address or mail server problem), the invoice’s status changes to Submission Failure. A red notice appears on the invoice. Staff can update the clinic’s email and resend.

Failure details are tracked separately from import data errors.

Line Deletion & Greyed‑Out History

Admins can remove line items after finalisation (e.g., wrong patient). Deleted lines are hidden from the clinic’s PDF but retained internally in a greyed‑out “Deleted Lines” section for auditing.

Bulk deletion is supported: select multiple lines, choose a reason (insurance, administrative error, duplicate), and confirm. Each deletion records the reason.

Parent‑Child Invoice Handling

Parent accounts can view and pay invoices for all children. Children see only their own. Payments from a parent may be allocated across multiple sub‑clinic invoices.

Parent invoices are not automatically aggregated; instead, parents view lists of child invoices with options to “pay all.”

Invoice Types (Categories)

Invoice types classify why the clinic is being billed: e.g., SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility) client billing, Invalid/Failure (missing documentation or insurance), Hospice, etc.

Each type can have its own price schedule and its own invoice per clinic per billing cycle.

Clinics may receive multiple invoices in a cycle if different types apply (e.g., SNF and Invalids). This prevents disputes in one category from holding up payment on others.

Invoice Filtering & Search

The invoice list page must support robust filtering. Users can filter by invoice number, clinic name, date range, invoice type, amount, sales representative, parent account and status.

A quick search field allows typing any term (e.g., patient name, invoice number, clinic) to narrow down results across multiple columns, similar to QuickBooks multi‑field search.

Columns display aging buckets (30/60/90/120+ days) and allow sorting ascending or descending. Filtered results can be exported to CSV.

Invoice List & Detail Layout

The invoice list displays columns such as: Invoice Number, Client/Clinic, Date Created, Due Date, Original Amount (draft), Balance Remaining, Status, and Aging category.

Opening an invoice reveals a structured detail view: each patient claim shows claim number, patient name, date of service, units, CPT/test code, description and price. Lines may expand or collapse to display additional information.

A running summary at the top of the detail page displays the total invoice amount, payments applied, credits applied and balance remaining. Actions such as Dispute and Pay are available per line.

Price Schedules & Mapping

Mapping Rules

Define how input codes (raw CPT/test codes or test names from the lab’s LIS or EMR) map to output codes used for billing. Each mapping includes: input code/name, output code, and an optional default price.

Mapping rules should be created first; price schedules then reference these codes to avoid typos.

Price Schedules (Fee Schedules)

Schedules specify the price per CPT/test code for a particular clinic or set of clinics. Columns include schedule name, start date, end date and a list of code–price pairs.

A schedule can be designated as default for a lab. When a new clinic is imported, the default schedule populates its prices automatically. Tests missing from a clinic’s custom schedule fall back to the lab’s default price.

Users create schedules by selecting codes from the mapping rules; the system should pre‑populate all codes with default prices for editing.

Units & Quantity Handling

Price schedules support a “units” field on each line so that charges requiring quantities (e.g., mileage) can be multiplied accordingly.

Default units are 1, but users can override in the import or manual entry.

Price Schedule Versions & Editing

Schedules have effective start and end dates to support historical pricing. New schedules can be created with overlapping or future dates.

Editing an existing schedule only affects invoices generated after the change; it does not retroactively alter sent invoices.

Import & Data Processing

CSV Template & Field Requirements

Template columns (in order): Clinic Name, Client/Lab, Invoice Type, Accession Number (sample ID), Date of Collection (mm/dd/yyyy), CPT/Test Code (input), Test Name (display), Units, Patient First Name, Patient Last Name, Patient DOB (mm/dd/yyyy), Display Note.

Clinic and client names must match exactly (case and punctuation) to existing records. Invoice type must match a predefined list. Dates must follow the required format. Display notes have a character limit to prevent enormous invoices.

The system should offer a downloadable sample file with one example row and instructions for each column.

Duplicate Detection & Accessions

The platform must detect if an accession number + CPT code combination has been invoiced before. Duplicates are disallowed unless manually overridden (to avoid double‑billing the same test). Accession numbers can contain special characters.

Duplicate checks run against the entire lab’s history, not just a single clinic.

Failure Queue

Valid rows are processed; invalid rows go into the failure queue. Each entry lists the accession number and reason (e.g., Clinic Missing, CPT Missing in Mapping, Invalid Date, Duplicate Accession/CPT). Failures auto‑delete after a certain timeframe (e.g., 30–90 days) to reduce clutter.

Users can filter by failure reason and take corrective action: add missing clinic, add missing CPT to the fee schedule, or correct data.

Reprocessing Logic

After fixing a failure, users select the affected lines and click Reprocess. The system re‑imports those lines and either appends to the appropriate draft invoice or creates a new invoice if the invoice was finalised.

Duplicates require manual override; a separate queue or tab lets users select duplicate lines and push them through with confirmation.

Clinic Matching via Sequence ID

To avoid problems with special characters and spaces, clinics may have a hidden sequence/ID field used for matching during import. Alternatively, clinic names must match exactly.

Import Error Handling

If dates are wrongly formatted, display notes too long, or mandatory fields missing, the row is rejected. The error queue explains what to fix. Admins may correct data in place through an inline edit or via re‑upload.

Incremental Additions to Draft Invoices

If a draft invoice already exists for a clinic and type, reprocessing can append new lines into that draft. Once finalised, new lines create new invoices rather than editing the finalised record.

Payment Processing & Credits

Payment Methods Supported

Credit Card – via Stripe (preferred) or other supported processors. Secure tokenisation should store cards on file if clinics choose.

ACH/Bank Transfer – via Stripe/GPI. Must confirm the account before posting.

Check – manually processed by billing staff. Payment is created as “Check” with check number and date, and posted through the payment queue.

Cash – rarely, but the UI allows marking a payment as cash (admin only).

Account Credit – represents a credit balance from overpayment; used like a payment method to apply existing credit to new invoices.

Payment Posting Queue

Lists payments that need applying (unposted), payments that are applied (posted), and those on hold/awaiting clarification. Each entry shows the clinic, amount, method, check number, payment ID and status.

Staff select a payment, see the clinic’s open invoices and line items, and allocate the payment line by line. An intuitive interface shows each invoice with a checkbox; expanding a small arrow reveals individual line items and their balances. Staff check each line and specify how much of the payment to apply. A running total displays Amount Received and Amount Applied, ensuring the unapplied amount is zero before saving.

Portal‑based payments (card/ACH) auto‑apply. Manual payments remain unposted until staff allocate them.

Partial Payments & Line Allocation

Staff and clinics can pay less than the full line amount. The system stores remaining balance and uses it in the next billing cycle.

The payment form must enforce that total applied equals the payment amount; partial application per line is allowed but no floating pennies.

Overpayment & Credit Handling

If payment exceeds the invoice total, the excess becomes an Account Credit. A credit entry is created with date, amount and reason. Credits are not treated as cash received until applied to an invoice.

Credits can be auto‑applied nightly (oldest invoices first) or manually applied from the payment queue.

Credits should be reported separately from payments to avoid inflating revenue.

A Bypass option may appear when an overpayment exists. Bypassing automatically converts the excess into a credit entry without requiring the user to allocate it immediately. Access to bypass should be restricted to authorised staff to prevent misuse.

On‑Hold & Disputed Payments

Payments may be placed on hold (e.g., awaiting bank clearance). On‑hold payments appear in the queue for staff review.

Chargebacks or returned checks require deleting or reversing the original payment. The system recalculates balances accordingly.

Payment Receipts

After posting, staff can print or email a receipt with payment details (date, method, amount, invoices/lines settled).

Dispute Management & Ticketing

Line‑Level Disputes

Clinics can dispute an individual line item by ticking a checkbox and entering a reason (free‑text). Only one dispute per line is allowed; after staff respond, the dispute field is locked.

When the dispute box is checked, the line’s payment amount auto‑zeros so the clinic does not pay it.

Ticket Creation

Each disputed line creates a ticket (case) in a dispute queue. Tickets store: ticket number, clinic, invoice number, line details (patient, CPT, amount), clinic’s reason, and status.

Disputes trigger notifications to billing staff. Staff can then open the ticket from the queue.

Ticket Processing & Responses

Staff choose an action: Accept Dispute (remove line or credit it), Deny Dispute (leave line as is), or Request More Info (ask the clinic for missing details such as insurance information). They add an internal note explaining their decision.

Tickets must track user‑submitted notes separately from internal notes. Ticket history should be visible to both sides, except internal notes remain internal.

After resolution, the ticket is marked closed. The invoice and line statuses update accordingly (line removed or payment expected). The clinic receives a notification or email.

Ticket Filtering & Aging

Admins can filter tickets by status (open, pending clinic response, closed) or by age (e.g., older than 30 days). Dashboards may show counts of open disputes.

Clinics see only their own tickets, with a “review” link to read staff responses or provide additional information.

One Dispute Only

Once resolved, a line cannot be disputed again. Staff may remove and reissue lines if needed but cannot reopen the same ticket.

Parent‑Child Accounts & Hierarchy

Parent Account Creation & Assignment

Admins can create parent accounts representing corporate entities (e.g., “Amedisys”). Each clinic record can reference one parent account.

In the database, parent accounts hold no financial transactions themselves; they aggregate balances from their children.

Parent‑Level Permissions

Parent users can view, dispute and pay invoices for all child clinics. They may also view consolidated aging reports for the entire group.

Payment allocation across children is allowed: e.g., apply a single ACH payment across 20 sub‑clinic invoices.

Hierarchy Depth

To avoid complexity, the system supports two tiers (Parent → Child) by default. SaaS deployments might add one more tier if needed but unlimited nesting is discouraged.

Reporting & Sales Rep Associations

Parent accounts can be linked to a sales rep. Reports can summarise total invoiced and paid amounts by sales rep, both at parent and child levels.

Reporting & Analytics

Invoice‑Level Reports

Generate lists of invoices with columns: invoice number, clinic, type, total amount, payments received, balance remaining, status and aging buckets (30/60/90+ days).

Filters include date range, clinic name, parent account, sales rep, invoice status. Exportable to CSV.

Line‑Level (Service) Reports

Produce a detailed list of every line item with patient info, accession number, CPT/test, units, price, payments applied, balance left, and line age. Useful for tracing specific tests or auditing accounts.

Payment Reports

List all payments with columns: payment ID, clinic, date, method, amount, applied amount, unapplied amount, check number, status (posted/unposted/on hold). Separate from credits.

Credit Reports

Track account credits by clinic: total credit balance, credit creation dates, reasons and amounts applied.

Sales Rep & Performance Reports

Summarise revenue and collections by sales rep. Useful for commission tracking and portfolio performance.

Dashboards & KPIs

Admin dashboards may show AR aging distribution, top clinics by outstanding balance, monthly trending of invoices vs payments, average days to payment, and top CPT/test codes. Clinic dashboards show simplified metrics (e.g., total outstanding, upcoming invoices).

Filtering & Drill‑Down

All reports should support multi‑select filters and drill‑down capabilities—for example, click on a clinic in the invoice report to see its line‑level details.

Security & Data Protection

Encryption in Transit & at Rest

All connections use TLS (HTTPS). Stored data (in databases, file storage) must be encrypted using AES‑256 or similar.

Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment

Prior to release, engage ethical hackers to test the system. Fix vulnerabilities identified in these tests.

HIPAA Logging & Compliance

Maintain detailed audit logs for all access and modifications. Provide mechanisms to export logs for compliance audits.

Data Isolation

Multi‑tenant SaaS deployments must isolate each lab’s data to prevent cross‑access. Clinics cannot see data from other labs.

User Interface (UI) Design Distinction

Red UI (Admin & Lab)

Includes complex menus for data import, invoice management, price schedules, payment posting, disputes, mapping rules, settings and reports.

All functions are available depending on permissions. Labs (internal) are view‑only, but in SaaS a lab could have its own red UI with full rights inside its data partition.

Blue UI (Clinic)

Simplified dashboard: shows only list of invoices and statuses, a “Pay All” button, individual invoice details with pay/dispute options, a dispute ticket view and a “Help” link.

The Help link directs clinics to a contact page or opens a modal with the billing team’s email address, phone number and a link to submit a support request. This ensures clinics always know how to get assistance.

No upload or mapping functions. Parent clinics can toggle among children.

Responsive Design & Accessibility

The interfaces should support modern browsers and mobile devices. Use clear labelling and accessible components (e.g., high‑contrast colours, ARIA labels). Ensure forms validate input and provide helpful error messages.
