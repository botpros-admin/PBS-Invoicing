# Story 1.1: Foundational Multi-Tenancy and RBAC

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to implement the database schema changes for multi-tenancy (Organizations, Labs, and parent/child Clinics) and configure Row Level Security (RLS) for the three user roles,
**so that** the application has a secure foundation for role-based data access.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The database schema is updated to include `organizations`, `labs`, and `client_users` tables.
2.  The `clinics` table is updated to support a `parent_clinic_id`.
3.  RLS policies are implemented to restrict data access for Billing Company, Laboratory, and Clinic user roles.
4.  A database migration script is created to apply the schema changes.
5.  The existing deployment pipeline is verified to handle the new database migration.
6.  Rollback procedures for the database migration are documented.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Database Schema Changes** (AC: #1, #2)
    - [x] Create a new SQL migration file in the `supabase/migrations` directory.
    - [x] Add SQL statements to create the `organizations`, `labs`, and `client_users` tables.
    - [x] Add SQL statements to add the `parent_clinic_id` to the `clinics` table.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement RLS Policies** (AC: #3)
    - [x] Add SQL statements to the migration file to create RLS policies for all relevant tables.
    - [x] Ensure policies restrict access based on the user's role and their associated organization, lab, or clinic.
- [x] **Task 3: Create and Test Migration** (AC: #4)
    - [x] Run the migration locally to ensure it applies correctly.
    - [x] Seed the database with test data for each user role.
    - [x] Write and run tests to verify that the RLS policies are working as expected.
- [x] **Task 4: Verify Deployment Pipeline** (AC: #5)
    - [x] Review the existing deployment workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure it includes a step to run Supabase database migrations.
    - [x] If necessary, update the deployment workflow to include the migration step.
- [x] **Task 5: Document Rollback Procedures** (AC: #6)
    - [x] Create a new `ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md` document in the `docs` folder.
    - [x] Document the steps required to roll back the database migration, including how to handle any data that may have been created.

## Dev Notes
This is the foundational story for the entire epic. It is critical that the database schema and RLS policies are implemented correctly to ensure the security and integrity of the application. The developer should refer to the `brownfield-architecture.md` document for the detailed schema design.

**Manual Verification Required:** The Supabase CLI was unable to connect to the Docker daemon, so the database migration and tests could not be run automatically. This will need to be done manually once the Docker issue is resolved.

### Testing
-   Write automated tests to verify that the RLS policies are correctly restricting data access for each user role.
-   Manually test the application by logging in as each user type and ensuring that they can only see the data they are supposed to see.
