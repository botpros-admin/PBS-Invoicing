# Stable Version Milestone

**Date:** 2025-08-05

This note confirms that as of the last deployment, the application has reached a **stable, fully functional, and performant state.**

All critical bugs reported in the `currentIssues` file have been resolved, including:

*   **Critical Routing Failure:** The 404 error when clicking invoices has been definitively fixed by correcting the navigation path in `Invoices.tsx`.
*   **Data Integrity Crashes:** All `TypeError` crashes on the Invoice Detail and Settings pages have been resolved by implementing robust, defensive data handling in the API services and components.
*   **Database Function Errors:** All database functions (`global_search`, `get_client_performance`, `get_top_cpt_codes`) have been corrected, and their permissions have been properly configured.
*   **UI/UX Inconsistencies:** All requested UI refinements have been implemented.

The workflows for Git, Supabase, and Netlify have been corrected and solidified. This commit (`180f628` and subsequent fixes) represents a reliable baseline for future development.
