Here is the transcript of the captions:
Ashley Zarling: fails and and keep discussing on the upload. We can also talk about the manual creation. I don't think the manual creations can be hard though, because it's all the fields that are in. The Excel, but just in a UI with drop-downs to select a clinic, select a patient, those kinds of things but we can go into that. Um,
You: Yeah, we can dial that. You know, dial down. Can. I mean, what else, what else do you could do? Think of off the top of your head? You know, that we could talk about or that there might be Things that we could cover.
Ashley Zarling: I'm well, I think we eventually and we can do it today needing to go back around to So we've talked about the UI for uploading, we've talked about the credit UI, we have talked about all these statuses pending those kinds of things. The thing we have not talked about in a second, go around is the UI on what it looks like to make a payment, your customer you log in. What does that look like? And how, how to dispute get routed? We haven't talked about that again. And then we haven't talked about reporting pretty much at all.
You: Yep.
Ashley Zarling: So would you like to go into the because we've kind of talked about what is all of this? Look like from Rhiannon's perspective. But like, what does this look like from a clinics perspective?
You: Whatever. Whatever is clever. We can we can talk about the
Ashley Zarling: As far as a login and a payment goes, if that's where you want to go next. Okay.
You: How a clinic? See. Okay. Is it clinic in a lab? The same thing. Stupid question
Ashley Zarling: No.
You: time. Okay. All right.
Ashley Zarling: Yep.
You: But a clinic and a clinic can be a lab.
Ashley Zarling: so, Not usually not not typically in our explanation. So I kind of put out those
You: Or no.
Ashley Zarling: parameters in the invoicing system stack to talk about.
You:
Ashley Zarling: A client is a lab and a clinic is a clinic or a facility and those are two very separate things because a lab is my customer a clinic or facility is their customer. This system is built for a lab to build their customers. We are just the managers of all of Right. So when we talk about billing access and admin level access, we are the people doing it but it could be a lab doing it. But essentially the the end user, the person receiving and seeing and making the payments is the clinic or the facility and I say facility because some of these are like long-term care facilities for like older people. They're not actually clinics. Some of them are clinics, right? We could even drill down further, Some of them are just collection agencies, so they're agencies, but to make it as simple as possible, we use the word clinic or facility to specify our clients client. So A is our client. B is our client's client. In this system, we're not billing. Our client, we're not sending out bills to the lab, through the system. We could figuratively speaking but we won't. We'll just use QuickBooks and actually use our QuickBooks for us eventually. That would be really nice and instead of all of our customers, but we're looking for a system for the lab to Bill Clinics. So just so you guys understand is like, we're navigating this space. A clinic will order samples and let's say they order those samples knowing the patients are going to cash pay upfront. So they have almost like a menu and so if they order these things, they do the math, they added up, They collect the cash from the patient up front and then we build them for those tests. And essentially, they're acting as an intermediate between the patient and us but they just collect the cash up front because they're a fully cash. Pay clinic. Our newest lab has a ton of this, so it's a bunch of cash, pay only doctors and wellness centers. That like a gym, employs a doctor and that doctor does wellness panels and does checkups on gym members of a certain level. That's all cash pay. That's how this is handled. Instead of a bill going to the patient. A bill goes the clinic. Or the facility. So that's kind of our management of this and that's why we did the subtypes the invoice types because an invoice could be for several reasons and we want to specify out what that is. So underneath the invoice typing, it could be because of a client bill arrangement. We have on file But the same clinic could also have an invoice generated because invalids, they failed to give us information to build the sample properly in a timely fashion. So they could have those two different invoices. And so as we talked yesterday about drafting invoices invoices would need To have the type labeled on them. Are they for skill? Nursing facility arrangements. Are they for a client bill arrangement? Are they for? You know, contractual arrangement issues, they didn't provide us, medical records, medical necessity, those kinds of things. So those are all reasons. Why something like that would be generated. Now, for the invoice typing, Rhiannon.
You: Yep.
Ashley Zarling: Right now I have told them each one needed to develop its own invoice. So all of sniff would go on an invoice. All of hospice would go on an invoice. The other thing we could do though is we could just add the category to one invoice. So, the invoice would have sniff and everything below. It's sniff. And then the next section would be invalids and everything below that is invalids and the next section. And it's all just one running invoice with just a splitter saying Everything below. This is for this reason.
Rhiannon Hobbs: Okay. Yeah, the only thing that I'm thinking of that. Might not be good with that. Is because let's say we have an invoice for sniff and invalid. It's all on one invoice. They might not pay out on that invoice until the invalids accounts are corrected. So, I don't know if it would be beneficial to have them separated because
Ashley Zarling: Gotcha.
Rhiannon Hobbs: Yeah, they might just not pay out until there's corrections or whatever.
Ashley Zarling: Yeah, I got you. So based off of the type Max Every a clinic could get three invoices in one month. Because the invoices are just different types altogether. the other thing we didn't talk about, Is a clinic could have. Two different fee, schedules for the two types. I've never seen it, but it could happen.
You: Could you give an example?
Ashley Zarling: Like for an invalid. So they never provided insurance information. A lab could say I want to collect the insurance allowable so they screwed me out of this money. I'm collecting the insurance allowable from them, which is going to be a different amount than the client bill. But I don't, let's not even that's a scenario. I don't think is gonna happen but I guess it could happen. If a clinic was or a lab was really pissed. Most the time though their fee schedule is contractual so I don't think that they would ever bill a different amount for a different reason. Anyways side tangent there. Um, so essentially max if a clinic has Skilled nursing facility patients. We're building them for those skilled nursing facility patients. So that's going to generate an invoice on an upload and then if the invoice type for the same clinic, Maxwell health, they also have five contractual failures, meaning. They didn't provide us with medical records or they didn't, you know, provide us with insurance information. Those would need to generate on to invoices. We know one of those is probably gonna be disputed and they're gonna try to provide us with the invalids and the medical records. The whole point in separating them off is to ensure that the other one just gets cleared and taken care of that. Invoice is off. We know this one's gonna be in dispute back and
You: Yep, makes sense.
Ashley Zarling: Does that sound right Rhiannon? Okay. I'm
You: Yeah. Okay.
Ashley Zarling: That was the tangent from your question. Max, our clinics and labs the same thing. No, they're not.
You: Okay. All right. um, All right, we spoke about because we'll have like the two different types. We'll have the draft and finalized. Let me see.
Ashley Zarling: Um, and this is really important when it comes to the user management Max. So we could almost bubble off like the system. I really wish at a whiteboard and you guys were here, because I would just go to town and I would because I want to know that you guys know what I'm saying, and I'm not just So stop me if you don't know what I'm saying, essentially. Add a new. Like the billing team is going to see everything. Like If this is all the data, Rhiannon has a billing administrator is going to see all of it and then because right now we have 11 labs Each lab is going to see their Section of the data, right? Like each lab is going to be able to view their piece of the data inside of there. So Pls is only going to see Pls data. Maxwell House, only gonna see Maxwell Health, Right? PCL Infinity, they're all going to see their own. And then their clients Are only going to be able to see their invoices, their amount due and their patients underneath every single one. And that's how the three levels of user management works. And then in billing, there's two different levels, one would just be a biller and the other would be administrative and the differences deleting Right. but otherwise people in labs get the same lab access, and that's kind of, as we talk about user management, like billing billing administration, The laboratory itself, the clinic. And those are the levels of user access that we were going to discussing if that makes sense.
Jermane Mack: Mm-hmm.
You: Okay. Okay.
Ashley Zarling: And the main UI is going to be dark blue and red. And then light blue. Because red would have you only access to everything underneath the dark blue. So a lab would be able to come in and see invoices. They become able to come in and see reports and download, but a lab's not coming in and building it invoice or doing like they would have a view only, essentially, of their section of dark blue, But this light blue has a different UI in the sense that they're going to log in. They're going to see a list of their invoices and have that UI that we talked about and I can pull up again where they can come in and dispute or pay They're not going to have reporting. We sure could build a dashboard, you know, where they can just say, like, How many of your payments are cleared? What do you have outstanding those kinds of things? But otherwise I don't think a clinic needs much else.
You: um, I, I just thought of something. What about like, parent accounts? like,
Ashley Zarling: Okay, if you want to get real specific care, Max, I will go one step further
You: Yeah.
Ashley Zarling: then. So then we're gonna have a parent account would be able to see all their children accounts inside of it. So it would be like another level inside of here
You: Yeah.
Ashley Zarling: where they would have the same level of a clinic access. But they would be able to manage their child account invoices. So if a parent account wanted to come in and they wanted to pay all the child accounts they could And see a dashboard on all their child accounts, they could, but it's the same kind of access.
You: Right? And this would be needed for The, you know the current implementation, right?
Ashley Zarling: Right.
You: we'd like, Okay.
Ashley Zarling: If we couldn't put it out and like we wanted to get like, like you said like good better best like what we would be shooting for is that, but if we couldn't do it, we could implement the system without it and try to figure it out down the road for sure.
You: All right, here's here's a scenario. What if like that parent company? Sends a large check for like, you know, to cover invoices for like 10 of its Subsidy. So sub locations or Or children.
Ashley Zarling: Yeah. Children. Yeah. if it sends a check, then we would need to be able to post it to Through the parent to all the children.
You: How yeah. How though like so like How would we want that to be applied?
Ashley Zarling: So, when we kind of talked about this last time, Let's go into QuickBooks actually. One. Second.
You: Sorry, if I'm taking taking you off, course.
Ashley Zarling: Now I every time we've taken us off course, I feel like we've done the most so take me off course.
You: Okay.
Ashley Zarling: That's where we get into the weeds and that's kind of what we need to figure out.
You: Yep. No, I agree.
Ashley Zarling: um, So, if I wanted to post a payment, I would come in here to post a payment and The way that QuickBooks manages the parent accounts is by having the parent account name, listed in front of the sub account or the child account. So, for everything, patient's choice, laboratories, this how we're managing them, right now the parent account. As soon as we assign them. Parent account above AIM Wellness, the name now appears patient's point, Left choice laboratory, you know, something, cool and wellness. Like, that is how it appears. Um, and so if I needed to close out payments and receive payments, let's say they send us the amount of three invoices put together when I went into that payment screen that we discussed and like, put in the payment The invoices and I selected a clinic. If I selected the parent, all the sub account invoices would appear If I selected individual clinic only that clinic. So, if I selected, aim wellness, like Patient Choice Laboratory, AIM wellness, only aim wellness But if I selected Patient's choice laboratory, AIM wellness would appear first care management would appear for Statics would appear like everything would appear. That goes underneath, that sub account. For application. A great example of this, we have a group called a medicine. It's a group of home health agencies. There's like a hundred and fifty of them, but they're all a medicine. So if I clicked a medicine Fort Lauderdale only in Madison's Fort Lauderdale would appear but I click a medicine Fort Lauderdale would appear Houston would appear, you know, Douglasville would appear all of them would show up.
You: You're saying med assist like m e. D a s s t like that's what it what it is.
Ashley Zarling: A medicis. A m. A d y s i s. There you go.
You: Uh-huh.
Ashley Zarling: A Medicis. They were just purchased by United Healthcare.
You: Gotcha.
Ashley Zarling: Right there, 3.3 billion dollars and their purchasing a hundred and fifty
You: Each.
Ashley Zarling: locations right now. So they're already about 150 locations and their purchasing 150 more. And they utilize one of our labs, so they are a clinic or facility.
You: Gotcha.
Ashley Zarling: So patient's Choice Laboratory has a medicine. A medicist is a corporate company that owns hospice careful like groups that drive around and do home health, and hospice care in home for people all over the country. There's 150 of them. There's about to be a hundred and fifty more So then we'd have a medicine and 300 Subclines below that. So, if I click to medicine Baton Rouge, I'd only post to a medisys Baton Rouge, but if I posted to a medicine, I would have the availability for everything.
You: Yeah. Well will there be like a sublevel to that like would there be more than just like the parent-child hierarchy would there need to be nested like
Ashley Zarling: I don't want to offer it. i don't know about you, Rhiannon but I wouldn't want to tell clinics like we could sub things further because then they would, And at some point of parent-child relationships on accounts, it would get very messy. Like it goes from an organizational health factor. To a mess.
You: Yeah.
Ashley Zarling: If we gave unlimited, like, tiering people be like, oh, then group the Louisiana once together. And then group these three together and the group, those four together, and then it would just say,
You: yeah, I mean we're not talking unlimited, you know, we do, we do you know want
Ashley Zarling: Yeah.
You: to have a limit but I'm just thinking like maybe you know, maybe
Ashley Zarling: We can offer one more below if we wanted to for Rhiannon in case a weird thing occurs. but,
You: Yeah, right. I mean
Ashley Zarling: The only thing I could think we'd we had it once. American health plans is an insurance company and it owns a ton of homes, but those homes weren't all the same kind of home. So some of them were called Ahc and some were called Ahcael. Or ale. And so those two groups we manage slightly different and they were all owned by American health plan. So there was different groupings for sure.
Rhiannon Hobbs: Well, well just think of the in the grand scheme of things though, but if we're going to market this or whatever to other people to use, then would you want to have that option there for that to be a potential?
Ashley Zarling: Yeah.
Rhiannon Hobbs: Because I don't know for us, I wouldn't want that. That's too much, but I don't
Ashley Zarling: Yeah.
Rhiannon Hobbs: know for other people.
Ashley Zarling: Yeah.
Rhiannon Hobbs: It doesn't have to be the default either. It can be like an option.
Ashley Zarling: Yeah.
You: You know, us. A subtle option or even like an administrative. Option. Where it's like, do you want to even allow? you know, you know, a three-tier hierarchy or or whatever, you know, it's, you know, I'm we're just kind of brainstorming thinking out loud Which is great, you know? Because these things we have to We literally have to like, think about these like, as we're Like before we we have like our product, like the what ifs like all of the
Ashley Zarling: Yeah, put that in forever ago.
You: potential. You know. Anomalies or things like things that we might not have, you know, like the the Hindsight 2020, you know, things that like well we kind of want to position ourselves. As if like, we're looking back and thinking, Oh man, you know, we have this one situation if only we would, you know, Yeah.
Ashley Zarling: So essentially in this dark red is admin. Light red. Is lab. Lab is view only. Right. Okay, so here's the problem. We have to create two versions of this one where the lab is. View only but Mack's when it goes into SAS base. A lab would be able to have to purchase this software and have admin level in their bubble. Yeah, but like for are use our labs would be, you only.
You: Okay.
Ashley Zarling: but just so you know, for like as far as the changes that go to make this, And then light and dark blue, have the same. View, or have the same. Permissions. As far as what they are allowed to do. Hey. but, They just get to see more or less. Invoices and clients. So, that would be kind of that thought process.
You: Understood.
Jermane Mack: So that the dark blue is individual. Clinics. So, that would be if the clinic wants to view its particular invoices.
Ashley Zarling: Yes. Yes, anyone can be a clinic, but some clinics would have parent accounts above them and that parent account would just be able to view whatever is going on in the sub account and make payments. Because sometimes they're just gonna want to view they like corporate accounts, want to know that they're lower accounts are paying their bills. Sometimes they're not even in a come in to pay the bill. A medicist may come in and say, Hey Charleston, a medicine. You aren't paying your bills and we have you access on this. Your bills are 90 days past due or whatever it might be. So in this case, like, a clinic would only be able to see what's inside of them as a clinic, but some clinics are going to have parent groups of
Jermane Mack: Eric. Yeah, and then the parent can see all of the clinics associated as the
Ashley Zarling: them. Yes.
Jermane Mack: children. Clinics.
Ashley Zarling: And remit payment and view balances.
Jermane Mack: Yep, so they can handle multiple clinics at that level with a parent account.
Ashley Zarling: Yep. Because some corporates do their own accounting in some corporate, don't. It just kind of depends.
You: Makes sense.
Ashley Zarling: Okay, so that's a little bit about that. You know, all stemming from that original question of like labs and clients and clinics and kind of what's going on there. Um, if we need to clarify our terms better. So like, every time we say lab, we mean, Light red bubble. And every time we say client, or every time we say clinic or facility, it's a blue bubble. Unlike just keep our terms as clean as possible for you all. So that, that way, you know, I I'll try not to stay client because everyone has clients right? Like, and just try to keep it as clean for you as possible. For the terminology, As you guys are doing this, I will do my best on that.
You: Yeah, you definitely have an excellent like visual like interface. Like you have a Like, what do you call it? Like someone like a designer's. You know, mind.
Ashley Zarling: You guys know I was a agility's corporate trainer. That is what I did gotta hit
You: Yeah.
Ashley Zarling: the visual learners as well, but it keeps me on track, otherwise, the train sometimes derails. um but like when I worked in the lab as an accessioning manager we had a room that had three whiteboards in it and we just kind of like Went to town to explain what we were talking about all the time. So it's just The background I come from. But yeah. So That's kind of, you know, that piece. Now, as far as like, we've talked a lot about red, right? We've talked a lot about payment, postings, developing invoices, those pieces, so we can then go into blue again.
You: Okay.
Ashley Zarling: because Blue is going to be This pay in response. So my thought process on this? They log in. There's going to be a list of invoices. Hopefully, it's not a long list, but there's gonna be a list, those lists in the same way, it's listed because I do like the UI here, a lot, and you're loading invoices screen. I think it's clean. I like how it looks. So they're gonna log in. It's gonna have dashboards invoices. Their invoices are going to say. Outstanding. Paid and partial. In dispute and closed. And that's it. That's what they're gonna have. They're gonna see giraffes. They aren't going to see exhausted. They're gonna see any of those things.
You: Working on this database that issue. I'm so sorry but yeah, I'm with you I'm
Ashley Zarling: You're good, you're good.
You: with you conceptually I'm right there with you.
Ashley Zarling: So there's specific status that will not be viewable to them. One of those is draft. What if those is exhausted? We're deleted, those are not viewables but they log in anything in a specific list of statuses is viewable to them.
You: Yep.
Ashley Zarling: They come in and they're going to have the option. I think we have a button to make things as easy as possible that says, pay all balances in full. They can clip it and we'll take them straight to Stripe and then it pays
You: Yep.
Ashley Zarling: everything. Otherwise they have to click the individual invoice and it takes them into this kind of UI. Where it's going to pull up the invoice. Just like, if I opened up, you know, any one of these invoices? It would open up the invoice to them. In their UI. It would instead of like a trash can, right? We talked about this situation where it's like dispute respond and they can check that off. It removes it from the paid balance. And then a box is going to appear underneath the patient here. So underneath the succession number, there's going to be a little note box. That note box is required in order for them to dispute it. So then they can't, they can't save without giving a reason why.
You: Yeah, they Right. Yeah, we'll have validation logic. If that field isn't, you know, doesn't have Whatever, at least like 10 characters, you know, they can't save.
Ashley Zarling: Perfect.
You: Or they can't. Yeah. Yep.
Ashley Zarling: okay, and then from there, They can edit their payment amount here, but the UI would show the charge if they type in 631. A payment of 631 would be ran by straight like at the end when they say but if they type in six dollars, six dollars would be in and then 31 cents would be the new balance. So if they opened this invoice, The new balance would say, 31 cents. What decides if that payment shows or not is if it's a posted payment. So we said like or an applied payment, we said that these ones would auto apply. So if they do it through the portal and they refresh the payment will auto apply based off of whatever they said they were running with stripe. Otherwise if they mail us in a check for the amount. That payment's not going to show until Rhiannon post it. So there, Yeah. So then they will come through here, they will put in their payment amounts, put in their disputes. The balance would be, whatever the balance column is added up. The total payments would be whatever the Payment column is added up. And then it would say Proceed to check out essentially. Or proceed to payment. And then we process the payment for whatever the total payment is.
You: Okay.
Ashley Zarling: When they click dispute or respond, that amount automatically like the payment amount would go to zero because they're not paying on that line. They're disputing it otherwise they could come in here, type in five dollars, ten
You: Yep.
Ashley Zarling: dollars, ten dollars. The total balance would be the six plus 10 plus 10, you know, and then the payment would be whatever they're paying. The 631 plus 10, 20 plus 10 20. And then if they were paying out $26, that would show the payment And then maybe we even put a line underneath it saying balance remaining. So total balance, total payment balance remaining after payment. so that way, if they're doing a partial payment, it will show
You: Okay. I like it.
Ashley Zarling: So then they go to the payment processing screen. Now. I want that to just be. Card or ACh.
You: Oh card or AC up? Okay, yep.
Ashley Zarling: Yeah. Now, Rhiannon there's a world where this would be nuts, but there's a world where someone would do their invoice response in here.
