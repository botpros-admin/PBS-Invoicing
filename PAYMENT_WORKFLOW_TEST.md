# Payment Workflow Test Guide

## ✅ Test Status: READY FOR MANUAL TESTING

The payment allocation system has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Payment recording (PaymentForm component)
- ✅ Payment queue display (PaymentQueue component)  
- ✅ Simple allocation interface (SimplePaymentAllocation component)
- ✅ Database schema with triggers for automatic balance updates
- ✅ Integration into PaymentsEnhanced page

## 🧪 Manual Test Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5181
3. Sign in or create an account

### Step 1: Create Test Data
1. **Create a Client:**
   - Go to Settings → Clients & Clinics
   - Add a new client (e.g., "Test Medical Clinic")
   - Save the client

2. **Create an Invoice:**
   - Go to Create Invoice
   - Select the client you just created
   - Add some line items with amounts
   - Save as Draft first
   - Then click "Finalize Invoice" to make it ready for payment
   - Note the invoice number and total amount

### Step 2: Test Payment Recording
1. **Navigate to Payments:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5181/payments
   - You should see the Payment Management page

2. **Record a Payment:**
   - Click "Record Payment" button
   - Select your test client
   - Enter the payment date (today)
   - Enter amount (e.g., same as invoice total for full payment)
   - Select payment method (e.g., Check)
   - Enter reference number if required
   - Click "Record Payment"
   - ✅ Payment should be saved and appear in queue

### Step 3: Test Payment Allocation
1. **View Payment Queue:**
   - Click "Payment Queue" tab
   - You should see your unposted payment
   - Status should show as "Unposted"
   - Queue status should show "Needs Allocation"

2. **Allocate Payment:**
   - Click the "Allocate" button on your payment
   - The allocation interface should open
   - Select the invoice from the dropdown
   - The allocation amount should auto-populate
   - Review the "After Allocation" preview
   - Click "Allocate & Post"
   - ✅ Payment should be allocated successfully

### Step 4: Verify Results
1. **Check Payment Status:**
   - Return to Payment Queue
   - Payment status should now be "Posted"
   - Allocated amount should match payment amount

2. **Check Invoice Status:**
   - Go to Invoices page
   - Find your test invoice
   - Balance due should be reduced by payment amount
   - If fully paid, status should show as "Paid"

## 📊 What's Working

### Core Features
- ✅ Manual payment entry with validation
- ✅ Payment queue management
- ✅ Simple payment-to-invoice allocation
- ✅ Automatic balance calculations
- ✅ Status updates (unposted → posted)
- ✅ Penny-perfect amount tracking

### Database Features
- ✅ payments table with all required fields
- ✅ payment_allocations table for tracking
- ✅ Triggers for automatic balance updates
- ✅ payment_queue view for UI display

## 🔄 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Payment
- Create invoice for $100
- Record payment for $100
- Allocate full amount to invoice
- ✅ Invoice should be marked as paid

### Scenario 2: Partial Payment (Next Phase)
- Create invoice for $200
- Record payment for $100
- Allocate to invoice
- ⏳ Invoice should show $100 balance remaining

### Scenario 3: Multiple Payments (Next Phase)
- Create invoice for $300
- Record payment #1 for $100
- Record payment #2 for $200
- Allocate both payments
- ⏳ Invoice should be fully paid

## 🐛 Known Limitations (To Be Addressed)

1. **Partial Payments:** Currently optimized for full payments
2. **Overpayments:** No credit system yet
3. **Multiple Invoice Allocation:** One invoice at a time currently
4. **Line-Level Allocation:** Invoice-level only for now
5. **Bulk Operations:** No bulk allocation yet

## 💡 Next Steps

Based on Ashley's requirements, the next priorities are:
1. Handle partial payments (payment < invoice total)
2. Handle overpayments (payment > invoice total)  
3. Add payment reports
4. Implement line-level allocation for complex cases
5. Add bulk allocation features

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The payment workflow is considered successful when:
- ✅ Payments can be recorded manually
- ✅ Payments appear in the queue
- ✅ Payments can be allocated to invoices
- ✅ Invoice balances update automatically
- ✅ All amounts balance to the penny

## 📝 Notes

- The system enforces penny-perfect accuracy as required by Ashley
- All payment amounts must be valid dollar amounts (2 decimal places)
- The allocation interface shows a preview of remaining balances
- Database triggers handle all balance calculations automatically
- The UI provides clear feedback at each step

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# View payment table structure (if needed)
node check-payment-table.js

# Check available test data
node check-test-data.js
```

**Status:** The payment allocation workflow is COMPLETE and ready for testing. This provides the foundation Ashley needs to record payments and allocate them to invoices with penny-perfect accuracy.
